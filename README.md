# 🎙️ AI Content Generator with Text-to-Speech 🤖🔊

This Python script enables you to generate content using Google's Generative AI (`gemini-1.5-flash` model) and have the response spoken aloud. It features a modular design for secure API key management and seamless text-to-speech functionality.

---

## ✨ How It Works

1. 📝 **Input Prompt**: Enter a topic or question when prompted.  
2. 🧠 **AI Response**: The script uses Google Generative AI to generate a relevant response.  
3. 📜 **Display**: The response is printed to the console.  
4. 🔊 **Speak**: The `speaking` module reads the response aloud using text-to-speech.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

1. 🐍 **Python 3.8+**  
2. 📦 **Dependencies**:  
   - `google.generativeai` (for AI interaction)  
   - A custom `speaking` module or compatible text-to-speech library.  

To install `google.generativeai`, run:  
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. 📂 Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository to your local system or download the script.

### 2. 🔐 API Key Configuration
Create a file named `api_key.py` to securely store your API key. It should look like this:

```python
key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY"
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never hard-code your API key directly into the script. Use separate files or environment variables to keep it secure.

### 3. 🎤 Text-to-Speech Setup
Ensure you have a `speaking.py` module with the following:

- `engine`: A text-to-speech engine object.
- `speak`: A function that speaks the provided text.

Example `speaking.py` file:
```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

Install `pyttsx3` with:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

When prompted, type your query:

```
Search: What is AI?
```

The script will:  
1️⃣ Fetch a response from Google's Generative AI.  
2️⃣ Print the response.  
3️⃣ Speak the response aloud.

## 🛠️ Example Output

**Input:**  
```
Search: What is AI?
```

**Output (Printed and Spoken):**  
```
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.
```

---

## 🧐 Troubleshooting

### 🛑 Missing Dependencies
Ensure all required libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai pyttsx3
```

### ❌ API Key Error
Make sure your `api_key.py` file exists and contains a valid API key.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech Issues
- If `pyttsx3` fails, check its installation and supported voice engines for your system.
